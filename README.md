# Eskom Calendar ðŸ”Œ ðŸ¦€

Sick and tired of complicated load shedding schedules? This project creates
up-to-date calendars that show you when load shedding is in your area.

To get your load shedding schedule in your calendar you should go to the
[latest release](https://github.com/beyarkay/eskom-calendar/releases) and
follow the instructions there.

The project is also open source! We depend on pull requests to update
`manually_specified.yaml` with the latest schedule. Please submit a PR if Eskom
announces a change!"

This is better than apps like EskomSePush, because an event will only appear in
your calendar if:
1. [Eskom](https://twitter.com/Eskom_SA) declares national loadshedding, and
2. Your area actually has loadshedding at that time, as defined by 
   [your areas loadshedding schedule](https://www.eskom.co.za/distribution/customer-service/outages/municipal-loadshedding-schedules/western-cape/).
